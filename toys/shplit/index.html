<h1>SHPLIT</h1>

<p>SHPLIT is the Strathclyde Haskell Pattern LIsting Tool. It makes
use of type information to figure out how to split a pattern variable
into its possible constructor forms. It's at a rather experimental
stage, just now, so caveat emptor. This directory is also a darcs repo.</p>

<p>The main <tt>shplit</tt> executable is a transducer, taking a .hs
file (sorry, no .lhs yet) from stdin and splatting a modified version
of the same to stdout. The associated lump of emacs lisp, if suitably
pasted into your .emacs, or whatever, should enable you to process the
buffer with <tt>M-x shplit-buffer</tt>, or attack the variable at
point with <tt>M-x shplit-this</tt> (bound to <tt>C-c C-c</tt>).</p>

<p>SHPLIT knows about a few standard datatypes, and the datatypes
declared in the input. A future version might be kind enough to chase
modules. SHPLIT can't handle records or GADTs. SHPLIT works only on
top-level prefix functions with an explicit (Hindley-Milner) type signature.
It's for beginners, just now.</p>

<p>To indicate that you want to shplit a pattern variable, just bung
<tt>{-?-}</tt> in the source code after it. Like this
<pre>
  foo :: [x] -> [x]
  foo xs{-?-} =
</pre>
Note that the <tt>=</tt> is needed as a clue that it's a program line,
but a right-hand side is not compulsory (and will be crudely
copied). You should get
<pre>
  foo :: [x] -> [x]
  foo [] =
  foo (x : xs) =
</pre>
back. SHPLIT tries to be slightly cunning with names, and is happy to
do more than one shplit at a time.
<pre>
  goo :: [x] -> [x] -> [x]
  goo xs{-?-} ys{-?-} =
</pre>
yields
<pre>
  goo :: [x] -> [x] -> [x]
  goo [] [] =
  goo [] (y : ys) =
  goo (x : xs) [] =
  goo (x : xs) (y : ys) =
</pre>
</p>

<p>There's plenty of room for improvement. It only took me a day to
knock it together. But it's fun to play with.</p>

<h2>Setting up your datatype</h2>

<p>If you just write any old Haskell 98 datatype, SHPLIT will make up
a vaguely sensible naming scheme, but you can roll your own, by
annotating your datatype declaration. Here's what I used for lists.
<pre>
  data {-xs-}[] x = [] | {-x-}x : {-xs-}[x]
</pre>
The annotation on the type head is a crude string pattern. All but the
first character match one character of the variable being split, and
the first character matches any remaining prefix. So matching
<tt>xs</tt> against a pattern variable <tt>yss</tt> would bind
<tt>x</tt> to <tt>ys</tt> and <tt>s</tt> to itself. If the pattern
variable is too short, the overhanging characters match themselves, so
matching <tt>xs</tt> against <tt>l</tt> would bind <tt>s</tt> to
<tt>l</tt> and <tt>x</tt> to itself. The resulting substitutions are
then applied to the name annotations which accompany each constructor
argument. So if the pattern variable is <tt>yss</tt>, it splits as
<tt>[]</tt> or <tt>(ys : yss)</tt>.
